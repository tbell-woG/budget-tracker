# Project Description
It is the beginning of 2021 and with each new year many people make New Years resolutions. Too often, people make resolutions to improve their management of their finances, increase their income, and decrease any unnessecary spending. With that being said, the Budget Tracker Application will make it easier for someone to track their budget and expenses and put them on their way to accomplishing their financial goals. This application will allow users to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection. When entering transactions offline, it should calculate the total when brought back online. They can log their transactions in by entering the transaction name and amount. Then they can click the "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds" buttons based off whether the transaction added or withdrew from their budget. When offline the user can enter their deposits and expenses. When they return back online, the offline entries will be added into the tracker. They can also view a graph summarizing of their budget.
